# HSK-WIZARD
HSK WIZARD is a web app (in progress) that allows a user to choose their Chinese proficiency level (HSK level 1-9). The HSK WIZARD will then generate a Chinese sentence in that level, removing the least frequently used word. Four multiple choice answers will be generated below the sentence, prompting the user to select the word that best completes the sentence. 

The HSK_sentences folder contains the lists of sentences sorted by their difficulty levels. 

The HSK_vocab_lists folder contains the vocabulary lists of the New HSK 3.0 exams, sorted by level.
